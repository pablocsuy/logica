# logica

> *"The logical calculus is easier to execute than any of the techniques of mathematics itself, yet only in 1934 did Gerhard Gentzen set it out in a natural way. Even now, mathematics students are expected to learn complicated (ε–δ)-proofs in analysis with no help in understanding the logical structure of the arguments. Examiners fully deserve the garbage that they get in return."* --- Practical Foundations of Mathematics, 1999, Paul Taylor, pp. 1-2.
